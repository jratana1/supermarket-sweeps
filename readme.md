Supermarket Sweeps is a Javascript/HTML game built with canvas.  To play, open index.html in your browser and the game will load.  Use the arrow keys to move and 'S' to interact.  Try to pick up all the items in your shopping list in 30 seconds.  You get 1 point for each item.  Pick up the wrong item and you lose a point.  

There is a back end server that you can run that will track user registration and scores.

To run the server, run 'bundle install', 'rails db:migrate', and then 'rails s' to run the server on localhost.  

Enjoy and happy shopping.
